1. Sum of Digits of a Number
Write a program that calculates the sum of the digits of a given number. For example, if the input is 12345, the output should be 15 (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5).

2. Count the Number of Digits in a Number
Write a program that counts how many digits are in a given number. For example, for the number 98765, the output should be 5.

3. Check if a Number is a Palindrome
Write a program to check if a given number is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards). For example, 12321 is a palindrome, but 12345 is not.

4. Reverse a Number Without Using Extra Space
Write a program that reverses the digits of a number without using an array or string. For example, if the input is 654321, the output should be 123456.

5. Find the Largest Digit in a Number
Write a program that finds the largest digit in a given number. For example, for the number 8392, the largest digit is 9.

6. Find the Product of Digits of a Number
Write a program that calculates the product of digits in a given number. For example, for the number 234, the output should be 24 (2 * 3 * 4).

7. Check if a Number is a Power of 2
Write a program to check if a given number is a power of 2. For example, 16 is a power of 2, but 18 is not.

8. Find the Number of Even and Odd Digits in a Number
Write a program that counts the number of even and odd digits in a given number. For example, for 123456, the number of even digits is 3 (2, 4, 6) and the number of odd digits is 3 (1, 3, 5).

9. Find the First and Last Digit of a Number
Write a program that prints the first and last digit of a given number. For example, for 34567, the first digit is 3 and the last digit is 7

10. Check if a Number is an Armstrong Number
An Armstrong number for a 3-digit number is one where the sum of the cubes of the digits is equal to the number itself. For example, 153 is 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3
